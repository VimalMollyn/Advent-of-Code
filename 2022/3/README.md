## Day 3

Started experimenting with using chatGPT as a stackoverflow replacement - very interesting suggestions! Learnt to get set intersections using the filter command. I couldn't get it to easily give me directly executable code, but will try again for Day 4. The best part for me was when I used it to explain an error message for me - it even offered a solution that worked!
